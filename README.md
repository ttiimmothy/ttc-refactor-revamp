# TTC Refractor Revamp

TTC Refractor Revamp is a revamp for [TTC Refractor](https://github.com/ttiimmothy/ttc-refractor) by using `Next.js` and `Tailwind CSS`. Since it used `Fluent UI` in `TTC Refractor`, there were many constraints in building a complex web application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12.0 or above)
- npm (which comes with Node.js) or Yarn (version 1.22.0 or above)

## Getting Started

Run the app locally

```
npm install
npm run start
```
