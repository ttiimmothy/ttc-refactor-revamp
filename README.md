# TTC Refactor Revamp
[![ci](https://github.com/ttiimmothy/ttc-refactor-revamp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ttiimmothy/ttc-refactor-revamp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

TTC Refactor Revamp is a revamp for [TTC Refactor](https://github.com/ttiimmothy/ttc-refactor) by using `Next.js` and `Tailwind CSS`. Since it uses `Fluent UI` in [TTC Refactor](https://github.com/ttiimmothy/ttc-refactor), there are many constraints in building a complex web application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12.0 or above)
- npm (which comes with Node.js) or Yarn (version 1.22.0 or above)

## Getting Started

Run the app locally

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
